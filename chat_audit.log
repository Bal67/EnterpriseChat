1. Wash the apple under cool running water to remove any dirt, pesticide residue, or wax coating.

2. You can eat the apple with or without peeling the skin off. The skin contains beneficial fiber and nutrients.

3. Hold the apple and take a bite out of the flesh. Chew thoroughly before swallowing.

4. As you eat around the core, you can either eat the core itself (it's edible but fibrous) or discard it once you get too close.

5. If you want to avoid getting apple juice running down your chin, you can slice the apple into wedges or chunks before eating.

6. For a cleaner way to eat, you can slice the apple horizontally and use a paring knife to remove the core before eating the apple slices.

7. Sprinkle with a little lemon or pineapple juice if you've sliced the apple to prevent browning if you won't eat it right away.

The most common way is to just wash it and take bites from the whole apple, turning it as you go. But slicing it first can make for neater eating.
